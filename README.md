## hiring 2.0 here we come!

Using Ganache, Python, and Streamlit I have created an interactive Web3 Employment application.

# Results

- Once you have selected your person, you are able to hire them for a number of hours.
- The total wage is displayed prior to the transaction being sent.
- Validated Transaction Hash provided once completed.
